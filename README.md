## 🕵️ The Mission

**ID.Forge** is a high-fidelity, multi-agent AI environment for the fabrication of AAMVA/ICAO-compliant government ID headshots. Designed for the privacy-conscious elite, v4.1.2 introduces a **Biometric Baseline Protocol** that scans your local hardware for physical landmarks before neural processing even begins.

Whether you are refining a master reference, generating a privacy-shielded lookalike, or laundering synthetic neural patterns to pass forensic scanners, ID.Forge provides the tools required for absolute identity autonomy.

## 💎 Premium Capabilities

### 1. Biometric Baseline Acquisition (NEW)
*   **Local Neural Scan**: Utilizing `face-api.js`, the system performs an offline scan of the subject's age, gender, and expression to establish a "Skeletal Baseline."
*   **Identity Anchoring**: This baseline ensures that even in `DISGUISE` mode, the resulting lookalike maintains biological plausibility by respecting the user's core bone structure.

### 2. Multi-Protocol Fabrication
*   **STANDARD PROTOCOL (The Refiner)**: Reconstructs casual input into a compliant Passport/ID photo with Studio Blue backgrounds and strict headroom standards.
*   **DISGUISE PROTOCOL (The Mirage)**: Precise soft-tissue shifting. Creates a "relative-class" lookalike to defeat automated facial recognition (AFR) while preserving human likeness.
*   **SYNTHETIC PROTOCOL (The Ghost)**: Text-to-Identity fabrication. Creates 100% synthetic humans with zero digital footprints.

### 3. Identity Laundering & EXIF Forgery (NEW)
*   **Professional EXIF Injection**: Every exported image now contains a forged metadata header mimicking a **Canon EOS R5** with an **RF85mm F1.2 L USM** lens. This removes any "Created by AI" signatures.
*   **The Grand Master Workflow**: A multi-stage restoration process that injects photon shot noise and re-textures "plastic" skin into raw CMOS-sensor quality.

### 4. Forensic-Grade Ingestion
*   **Format Flexibility**: Now ingests `.JPG`, `.PNG`, `.WEBP`, and forensic containers like `.PSD` and `.PDF`.
*   **Hardware Intelligence**: System informs users of the target **600-1200 DPI** range required for physical CR80 card fabrication.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

ID.Forge is a browser-native fortress powered by:
- **Core Engine**: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro & 2.5 Flash.
- **Local Vision**: `face-api.js` for biometric baselines and OpenCV.js for sensor noise injection.
- **Persistence**: `RxDB` with `Dexie` for a secure, local-only neural archive (Photo History).

## 📖 Operational Guides

### OP 1: The Master Refine
1.  Set **Protocol** to `STANDARD`.
2.  **Ingest Master**: Upload your source (now supports PSD/PDF).
3.  **Baseline Lock**: System scans your face locally to ensure the AI doesn't deviate from your age/gender.
4.  **Fabricate**: Click Generate. The system launders the results through the "Grand Master" textures.
5.  **Export**: Save with injected Canon EOS R5 metadata.

### OP 2: The Evasion Disguise
1.  Set **Protocol** to `DISGUISE`.
2.  Upload source. System establishes baseline.
3.  AI shifts soft markers (+/- 5 years, facial width) to break AFR fingerprint.
4.  **Forensic Scan**: Use the built-in scanner to verify the AI Probability score is low enough for deployment.

### OP 3: The Ghost Persona
1.  Set **Protocol** to `SYNTHETIC`.
2.  Input traits (e.g., "Latino male, 40s, sharp jawline").
3.  Set **Skin Detail** to `ENHANCED`.
4.  Export for high-resolution 4K identification.

## 🧠 F.A.Q.

**Q: How do I remove the AI "Signature"?**
A: V4.1.2 does this automatically. The "Grand Master" restoration stage applies professional grain and injects Canon EOS R5 metadata into the header.

**Q: Why does the system ask for 600 DPI?**
A: Physical ID fabrication requires high pixel density. 600-1200 DPI ensures that the micro-textures of the skin (pores/fine lines) are preserved when printed onto plastic.

**Q: What is the "Biometric Baseline"?**
A: It's a local scan that happens before the AI sees your image. It tells the AI: "This person is 30 years old and Male," preventing the AI from hallucinating a different age or gender during the reconstruction.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1.  **PDF Exports**: Use the PDF export for printing; it's pre-sized for CR80 standard card dimensions.
2.  **Privacy**: Use `DISGUISE` protocol for social media avatars to poison facial recognition datasets.
3.  **History**: Clear your "Photo History" frequently to purge the local memory bank.
4.  **Ingestion**: If uploading a PDF, the system will process it as a secure biometric container.
